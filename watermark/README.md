# Day 84 Watermark an image

## Course Objective

Using what you have learnt about Tkinter, you will create a desktop application with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) where you can upload an image and use Python to add a watermark logo/text.

### Personal Adjustment:

Initial creation as CLI based tool taking arguments to mark a single file or all files in a folder. Build as a Class that can be later reused with a GUI interface
